# LPEngine v1.0
 
<p>This is a front-end API that helps create interactive content for web browsers. It has an entire library of functions for creating 'GameObjects' that can be programmed with various behaviors. The engine executes these behaviors and updates the properties of these GameObjects every frame, whose changes are then reflected graphically on the web browser. There is also basic physics, collision detections and 3D graphics support. It uses PIXIjs for drawing graphics over WebGL, and is entirely written in Javascript </p>
