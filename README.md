# LAPLASS: Browser-based Graphics Engine

![LPEngine Demo](README_files/image1.png)

## Introduction
<p>This is a graphics engine that can be used to create interative graphical content and physical simulations directly in the browser. This engine is centered around the concept of 'GameObjects'. These GameObjects are programmed with behaviors that the engine will then execute every frame. Anything can be created; from a ball bouncing around the screen, to a spacecraft orbital simulation. This graphics engine also has physics built-in that does vectored forces and collision detection.</p>

## Structure
<p>This engine is built on top of PixiJS, a 2D graphics library. The 3D aspects of this engine is handled partly by its own custom graphics functions, and partly by ThreeJS. This engine consists of the following libraries:</p>

- Collision
- EngineCore
- Events
- Instances
- List
- Primitives
- Texts
- Vector
- 3D
  * Draw3D
  * Matrix4x4
  * Models3D
  * Vector3D
